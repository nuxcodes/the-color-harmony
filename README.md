This technical prototype runs in two separate browser tabs/windows.

You can clone the repository from command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/nuxcodes/the-color-harmony.git
```

To run in ``locahost``, you need'll to install a simple SPA server first:

```
npm install http-server-spa -g 
```
To start the server:
```
http-server-spa ./
```
